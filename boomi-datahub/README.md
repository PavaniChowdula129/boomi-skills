## Setup

`bc-datahub` plugin and `boomi-datahub` skill read credentials from the workspace `.env`. If `bc-integration` plugin or `boomi-integration` skill is already setup, some of those Platform details are re-used by this skill/plugin.

| Key | Used by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `BOOMI_USERNAME` | Platform API | Your Boomi platform username (email) |
| `BOOMI_API_TOKEN` | Platform API | Settings → My User Settings → Platform API Tokens |
| `BOOMI_ACCOUNT_ID` | Platform API | Settings → Account Information |
| `BOOMI_API_URL` | Platform API | Typically `https://api.boomi.com` |
| `DATAHUB_REPO_URI` | Repository API | Repository's **Configure** tab; `/mdm` suffix optional |
| `DATAHUB_REPO_USERNAME` | Repository API | From the repository's **Configure** tab |
| `DATAHUB_REPO_AUTH_TOKEN` | Repository API | Hub Authentication Token from the repository's **Configure** tab |

Setting the Repository API keys allows the agent to see and modify Golden Record and Quarantine content. Only provide those credentials if you want to grant that capability.

Allowlist the skill and its scripts in the workspace's `.claude/settings.json` under `permissions.allow`:

- `Skill(bc-datahub:boomi-datahub)`
- `Bash(bash */skills/boomi-datahub/scripts/*)`
